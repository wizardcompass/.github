# Wizard Compass

Philosophy: More than an audit tool — **it’s a boundary**.

## Our believes
  
We believe in creating a healthier, more transparent web — one built with care, speed, accessibility, and respect. Our compass doesn’t just point north; it draws a  **circle** around what matters. It defines what belongs and what doesn’t. What serves the user and what exploits them. 

We rely on services like huge companies. We value their reach, infrastructure, and impact. But Wizard Compass also holds a quiet conviction: **not every rule written by big platforms should govern us without question** — especially when those rules prioritize data collection over user consent or advertising over experience.

We don’t brag about bypassing anything. We don’t publish posts that weaponize knowledge or teach people how to break the rules of others.

## Our mission

Instead, we draw ethical lines in code, in privacy, in design —  And we quietly make sure they’re not crossed.

Wizard Compass protects creators and their users alike.  Not with loud defiance, but with **silent clarity**.

We don’t fight the system.  We just build our own — responsibly, beautifully, and independently.

## The tip of the iceberg

Six auditable categories, which over time will encompass over 200 checks
From officia third-party APIs, CLI, tools, self-written bulletproof bash commands, plugins, ethical bots, and more.
